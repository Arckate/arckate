# Arckate

**Connect your Business. Discover your flow.**

In many organizations, communication is broken.  
Documentation is scattered, static, and often makes things worse.  
Teams speak different languages â€” design, dev, HR, ops â€” and the glue is missing.

**Arckate** is a new approach.

Itâ€™s a modular system that turns metadata into a shared language across your enterprise.  
Not through more docs â€” but through living, versioned, visualized flows.

## What is Arckate?

Arckate is a Git-native ecosystem of tools that help you:

- **Generate** metadata from code and tools
- **Sync** it across systems
- **Visualize** it to reconnect teams

Itâ€™s composed of three open-source projects:

---

### ![Grimoire Logo](./assets/arckate-grimoire-icon.png)     [Grimoire](https://github.com/Arckate/grimoire)

> A CLI framework to build better developer tools.

Grimoire helps you scaffold and test CLI tools with great DX.  
It can also generate `.gen.{json,yaml,md...}` metadata from codebases.

---

### ![Curse Logo](./assets/arckate-curse-icon.png) [Curse](https://github.com/Arckate/curse)

> A plugin-powered CLI to sync your tools with Git.

Curse connects tools like Figma, Jira, Workday, and Penpot â€” extracting and injecting metadata via `.gen.{json,yaml,md...}` files.

---

### ![Sorcery Logo](./assets/arckate-sorcery-icon.png) [Sorcery](https://github.com/Arckate/sorcery)

> A visual interface to explore and enrich your metadata.

Sorcery lets you visualize `.gen.{json,yaml,md...}` files from multiple repos, stream live logs, and edit metadata with context â€” from architecture to org charts.

## Why Arckate?

Because your business is more than documents.  
Itâ€™s flows, systems, people, and decisions â€” and they deserve a better way to connect.

> Arckate helps you reopen the conversation.  
> Not with static docs, but with dynamic, shared metadata.
